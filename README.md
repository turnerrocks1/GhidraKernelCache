# GhidraKernelCache
Forked from 0x36 on github who then rewrote the ida_kernelcache python framework. Sadly 0x36 doesn't seem to have push updates to the project and it took me a very long time to figure out why this wasn't working with ghidra i finally found the ghidra api html source and saw that in 10.1 some of the functions used was either entirely removed or just plain depricated.
